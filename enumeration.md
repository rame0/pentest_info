https://github.com/OJ/gobuster

Gobuster is a tool used to brute-force:

* URIs (directories and files) in web sites.
* DNS subdomains (with wildcard support).
* Virtual Host names on target web servers.
* Open Amazon S3 buckets

```sh
gobuster dir -u http://10.10.150.177/ -w /path/to/SecLists/Discovery/Web-Content/directory-list-lowercase-2.3-medium.txt
```
Here we are using wordlist provided by SecLists to enumerate through common file/dir names to find if something might be used.
